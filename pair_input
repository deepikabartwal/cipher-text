find it recorded in my notebook that it
was a bleak and windy day towards the
end of March in the year 1892. Holmes
had received a telegram while we sat at
our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made
no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts,
for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a
thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an
occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he
turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his
eyes.
“I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as
a man of letters,” said he. “How do you define the
word ‘grotesque’?”
“Strange—remarkable,” I suggested.
He shook his head at my definition.
“There is surely something more than that,”
said he; “some underlying suggestion of the tragic
and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some
of those narratives with which you have afflicted
a long-suffering public, you will recognize how often
the grotesque has deepened into the criminal.
